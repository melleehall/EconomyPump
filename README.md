# Economy Pump

Economy Pump provides users with insight to a selected state's Median Household Income relative to the United States average and a list populated with Etsy products from storefronts located in the chosen location. Users are empowered to make thoughtful purchases and encouraged to embrace the power of their dollars by "shopping small".

## Motivation

I wanted to give users an easy way to support small businesses and provoke thought about the impact of each purchase they make.
